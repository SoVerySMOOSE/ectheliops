SENTINELOPS — PROJECT DESCRIPTION (VERY SIMPLE TERMS)

SentinelOps is a program that watches APIs so humans don’t have to.

You give SentinelOps information about an API you depend on:
- the URL (where the API lives)
- how to call it (GET, POST, headers, API key)
- how often it should be checked

SentinelOps then runs forever in the background and does the same thing repeatedly:
1. Call the API
2. Measure how long it takes
3. Record whether it worked or failed
4. Save what the response looked like

The key idea:
SentinelOps remembers the past and compares it to the present.

If something changes in a dangerous way, SentinelOps notices.

Examples of dangerous changes:
- An API field that used to exist is missing
- A field changed type (number → string)
- The response structure changed shape
- The API starts timing out or getting slow

SentinelOps does NOT fix APIs.
SentinelOps only watches, remembers, and warns.

Why this matters:
Most real-world software failures happen because something changed silently.
SentinelOps is designed to catch silent failures early.
