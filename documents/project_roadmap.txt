ECTHELIOPS — UPDATED PROJECT ROADMAP (v2)

ASSUMPTIONS - 6–10 focused hours per week - Learning while building -
Goal: Resume-worthy, production-like SaaS project - Target completion:
12–16 weeks

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  CURRENT STATUS
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  PHASE 2 — FRONTEND INTEGRATION (1–1.5 weeks)

  GOAL: Make backend data visible and interactive in the
  browser.

  YOU ARE BUILDING: - Monitor list view (fetch GET
  /monitors) - Create monitor form (POST /monitors) - Delete
  monitor button - Basic error handling

  YOU ARE LEARNING: - Fetch API - React state management -
  Component structure - Frontend ↔ Backend integration - CORS
  basics

  DONE WHEN: You can: - Add a monitor from the UI - See it
  persist in DB - Refresh page and still see it

  This is your first demoable milestone.
  ------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE 3 — RUNNING CHECKS & STORING RESULTS (1–2 weeks)

GOAL: Make the system perform real API health checks.

YOU ARE BUILDING: - check_results table - HTTP call execution logic -
Latency measurement - Success/failure tracking

YOU ARE LEARNING: - Timeouts - Error handling - Data persistence - Clean
service-layer design

DONE WHEN: You can trigger a check and retrieve stored results.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  PHASE 4 — BACKGROUND WORKERS & SCHEDULING (1.5–2.5 weeks)
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  PHASE 5 — CONTRACT DRIFT DETECTION (2–3.5 weeks)

  GOAL: Detect structural API response changes.

  YOU ARE BUILDING: - JSON structure comparison logic - Drift
  detection storage - Change event records

  YOU ARE LEARNING: - Data modeling for correctness - Edge
  case handling - Defensive programming

  DONE WHEN: Intentional API changes are detected and
  recorded.
  ------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE 6 — ALERTS SYSTEM (1–2 weeks)

GOAL: Notify users automatically when problems occur.

YOU ARE BUILDING: - Alert triggers - Notification dispatch
(email/webhook) - Alert throttling

YOU ARE LEARNING: - Event-driven architecture - Notification patterns -
Failure-state modeling

DONE WHEN: System sends alerts without user interaction.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  PHASE 7 — AWS DEPLOYMENT (1.5–3 weeks)
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  PHASE 8 — POLISH & SENIOR-LEVEL IMPROVEMENTS (1–2.5 weeks)

  GOAL: Elevate project beyond tutorial-level.

  YOU ARE ADDING: - Rate limiting - Observability (structured
  logging) - Health endpoints for workers - Basic auth or JWT
  auth - CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

  STOP RULE: Stop when: - System feels cohesive - You can
  explain architectural decisions - You can demo confidently
  ------------------------------------------------------------

STRATEGIC NOTE

Most portfolio projects stop at CRUD.

EctheliOps will demonstrate: - Backend architecture - Database
migrations - Background processing - Frontend integration - Cloud
deployment - Infrastructure knowledge

This moves it from “learning project” → “junior/mid-level SaaS
engineering project.”
