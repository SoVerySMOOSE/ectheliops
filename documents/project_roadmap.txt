SENTINELOPS — ROADMAP WITH OVEREXPLANATION

IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION:
You are learning as you go.
Progress will feel slow at first. That is expected.

Average pace assumed:
6–10 focused hours per week.

TOTAL EXPECTED TIME:
12–16 weeks for a solid, resume-ready v1.

--------------------------------------------------
PHASE 0 — Foundations (3–5 days)

GOAL:
Understand the absolute basics without pressure.

WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING:
- How HTTP requests work
- How FastAPI starts and responds
- How to run things locally

DELIVERABLES:
- A FastAPI app that starts successfully
- One endpoint that returns “hello world”
- One Python script that calls a public API

YOU ARE DONE WHEN:
You can explain out loud what happens when:
“my program calls an API and gets a response.”

--------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1 — API Monitor CRUD (1.5–2.5 weeks)

GOAL:
Teach the system to remember APIs.

WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING:
A backend that lets users create and manage “monitors.”

WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING:
- REST APIs
- JSON request/response bodies
- Database basics
- Data modeling

EXAMPLES:
A monitor includes:
- name
- URL
- HTTP method
- headers
- check frequency

YOU ARE DONE WHEN:
You can create a monitor and see it stored in the database.

--------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 — Running Checks & Storing Results (1–2 weeks)

GOAL:
Teach the system to actually do work.

WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING:
Code that:
- makes HTTP calls
- measures latency
- records success or failure

WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING:
- Error handling
- Timeouts
- Persisting historical data

YOU ARE DONE WHEN:
You can trigger a check and retrieve past results.

--------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3 — Background Jobs & Scheduling (1.5–2.5 weeks)

GOAL:
Decouple work from user requests.

WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING:
- A worker process that runs checks
- A scheduler that decides WHEN to run them

WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING:
- Background processing
- Queues
- Long-running systems

YOU ARE DONE WHEN:
Checks run automatically without you clicking anything.

--------------------------------------------------
PHASE 4 — Contract Drift Detection (2–3.5 weeks)

GOAL:
Detect dangerous API changes.

WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING:
- JSON “shape” comparison logic
- Change detection events

WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING:
- Data comparison
- System correctness
- Edge cases

YOU ARE DONE WHEN:
You can intentionally break a response and see SentinelOps detect it.

--------------------------------------------------
PHASE 5 — Frontend UI (1.5–3 weeks)

GOAL:
Make the system visible to humans.

WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING:
- Dashboard
- Charts
- Tables

WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING:
- How frontend talks to backend
- How data becomes visuals

YOU ARE DONE WHEN:
You can demo the system in a browser.

--------------------------------------------------
PHASE 6 — Alerts (1–2 weeks)

GOAL:
Make the system proactive.

WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING:
- Alert triggers
- Notification delivery

WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING:
- Event-driven thinking
- Failure response

YOU ARE DONE WHEN:
You receive an alert without checking the UI.

--------------------------------------------------
PHASE 7 — AWS Deployment (1.5–3 weeks)

GOAL:
Run SentinelOps without your laptop.

WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING:
- Cloud deployment
- Managed databases
- Logging

WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING:
- Cloud basics
- Infrastructure responsibilities

YOU ARE DONE WHEN:
SentinelOps runs while your laptop is off.

--------------------------------------------------
PHASE 8 — Polish (1–2.5 weeks)

GOAL:
Demonstrate senior-level thinking.

WHAT YOU ARE ADDING:
- Rate limiting
- Observability
- Reliability improvements

STOP RULE:
Stop when the system feels real and understandable.
